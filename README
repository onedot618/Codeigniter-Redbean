OVERVIEW
This library for Codeigniter enables and autoloads Redbean, a fantastic ORM for PHP (http://www.redbeanphp.com).
As Redbean supports mysql, pgsql, and sqlite, this library allows for the same via its config file.

INSTALLATION
Copy the files into their respective folders within <codeigniter>/application/. If you have a custom autoload.php
located in your config directory, please be sure to merge the file to prevent data loss.

USAGE
Open the config/redbean.php configuration file and set the appropriate values for the driver, host, database name,
username, and password. If you are using sqlite, be sure to set the db_path variable.

NOTES
Redbean has some very nice options which are utilized via config entires. For example, if your environment variable
is set to "production," then Redbean will freeze the schema so that no new tables will be created on the fly. Further,
if you want to see the exact queries that Redbean is generating, you can change the value of 'rb_debug' to TRUE.
This will interfere with session usage, so keep that in mind.
